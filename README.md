## Description
The Time Capsule Project is a web application that allows users to create and manage entries that they wish to store for future viewing. Each entry can include details such as events, open dates, areas, notes, favorites, and bucket lists. The application supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing entries and allows users to lock entries until a specified open date.
