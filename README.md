## Description
The Time Capsule Project is a web application that allows users to create and manage entries that they wish to store for future viewing. Each entry can include details such as events, open dates, areas, notes, favorites, and bucket lists. The application supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing entries and allows users to lock entries until a specified open date.
The application uses a public API for storing and retrieving data asynchronously, ensuring all interactions are smooth and dynamic. The entries are displayed in a clean, user-friendly layout, with the option to edit or delete entries. The app includes form validation and allows users to upload images for each entry, making it a personal and customizable experience.
